# Customer Referral System Proposal for

# WooCommerce Integration

# Executive Summary

The Customer Referral System is a custom WordPress plugin designed to integrate seamlessly  
with WooCommerce, creating a self-reinforcing ecosystem that incentivizes user engagement,  
drives customer acquisition, and boosts retention. By leveraging behavioral psychology  
principles such as loss aversion, social proof, and gamification, the system transforms users—  
particularly coaches—into passionate brand ambassadors. The plugin introduces a credit-  
based reward system, unique referral links, and tiered incentives to achieve the following  
strategic outcomes:

* Increase first-time customer acquisition by 40%+ through user-driven referrals.  
* Enhance customer lifetime value via improved retention and repeat purchases.  
* Transform coaches into long-term brand advocates with vested interest in platform  
  growth.  
* Create a sustainable growth engine independent of traditional marketing spend.

This proposal outlines the system’s functionality, user roles, technical implementation, and  
success metrics, providing a roadmap for development and deployment.

# System Overview

The Customer Referral System is a WordPress plugin that integrates with WooCommerce to  
provide a robust referral and rewards framework. It introduces a credit-based system where  
users earn credits through purchases and referrals, which can be redeemed for discounts or  
commission payouts. The system supports multiple user roles, each with tailored incentives,  
and leverages unique referral codes and custom URLs to track and reward user-driven growth.  
User Roles  
The system defines five distinct user roles, each with specific functionalities and incentives:

1. Customer: Standard WooCommerce shoppers who earn credits through purchases and referrals, redeemable as store discounts.  
2. Coach: Key advocates who earn credits through purchases, referrals, and customer  
   partnerships, redeemable as monthly commission payouts or store discounts.  
3. Content Creator: Users who earn credits similarly to customers, with redemption as monthly commission payouts to incentivize promotional content.  
4. Partner: Users who earn credits through referrals and partnerships, redeemable as monthly commission payouts, encouraging strategic alliances.  
5. Admin: Platform administrators with access to manage the referral system, monitor performance, and configure settings.

## Credit System

The credit system serves as a digital accounting mechanism, representing a percentage of  
WooCommerce purchases. Credits incentivize user actions and are accumulated as follows:  
Customers: Earn credits for their own purchases and successful referrals (tracked via  
browser cookies). Credits are redeemable as discounts at checkout, compatible with  
WooCommerce coupons.  
Coaches: Earn credits as customers do, plus additional credits through customer  
partnerships. Credits can be redeemed as monthly commission payouts or store discounts.  
Content Creators: Earn credits like customers, redeemable as monthly commission  
payouts to reward promotional efforts.  
Partners: Earn credits through referrals and partnerships, redeemable as monthly  
commission payouts.  
Admins: Do not earn credits but manage the credit allocation and redemption processes.

## Partnerships

The partnership feature extends the referral system by allowing customers (e.g., parents) to  
"partner" with coaches. This incentivizes coaches to recruit new customers and encourage  
repeat purchases without additional cost to the customer. Coaches earn credits for each  
purchase made by their partnered customers, fostering long-term engagement and loyalty.

# Referral System Mechanics

The referral system is designed to be user-friendly and scalable, leveraging unique codes and  
custom URLs to track referrals across platforms.

## Components

Unique Code: Each user receives a unique referral code embedded in their custom URL.  
Custom URL: A shareable link (e.g., example.com/referral?code=UNIQUECODE ) that  
users can distribute via social media, email, or text messages.

## System Workflow

1. User Registration: Upon account creation, every WordPress user (regardless of role) is  
   assigned a unique referral code and custom URL.  
2. Referral Tracking: When a new user visits the site via a custom URL, a browser cookie  
   stores the referral code, linking the new user to the referrer.  
3. Credit Allocation:  
   1. Customers earn credits for their purchases and for purchases made by referred users.  
   2. Coaches earn credits for their purchases, referrals, and purchases made by partnered  
4. customers.  
5. Content Creators and Partners earn credits for their purchases and referrals.  
6. 4\. Credit Redemption:  
7. Customers redeem credits as discounts during WooCommerce checkout.  
8. Coaches, Content Creators, and Partners redeem credits as monthly commission  
9. payouts or store discounts.
